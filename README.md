# Palindrome-Checker
A simple palindrome checker using recursion rather than the double-pointer method.

This palindrome checker utilizes recursion to check if all of the alphabetic characters in a string form a palindrome while ignoring the non-alphabetic characters.
The Scanner library is used to accept user input from the terminal.

To run the program enter a string when prompted and the program will output whether or not it is an alphabetic palindrome.
